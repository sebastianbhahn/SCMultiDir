# SCMultiDir
Made this to convert html files from a specific interactive story website into a more locally readable format.
Files are from 2019 specifically. likely doesn't work for other years.
Tested working for most but not all stories from the archive year I have on hand.
SC stands for "story cleaner". MultiDir as this is the final version which iterates over multiple directories.
The reason I have these files and wanted to convert them, is, uh, private.
But I figured I could share the code since it was a pain to make.
Basically the first "complicated" program I've made.
Runs as an exe from the top directory where the folders with the stories in them are located,
iterates through each folder. only effects html files.
